# fliclib-ios
The fliclib framework for iOS.
This framework works in collaboration with the Flic app so please make sure that you have it installed before you begin.

Notice: The instructions and documentation available at our website have not been updated to work with the latest release of the framework. This will be done soon.
For instructions on how to implement this go to https://flic.io/partners/developers/ios-tutorial, or take a look at one of our example projects here on github.
