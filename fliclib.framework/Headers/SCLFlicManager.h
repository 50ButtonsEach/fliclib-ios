 *                  and collect the associated flic objects using the <code>knownButtons:</code> method.

 *                  the last known state of the most previous manager created by the same app. If you choose to create a new manager then any old
 *                  manager (if existing) will be irreversibly cleared. Using more than one manager in the same application is not supported.
